    8. Name and Email Addresses
    Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as key-value pairs.
    The program should display a menu that lets the user look up a personâ€™s email address, add
    a new name and email address, change an existing email address, and delete an existing
    name and email address. The program should pickle the dictionary and save it to a file
    when the user exits the program. Each time the program starts, it should retrieve the dictionary
    from the file and unpickle it.
