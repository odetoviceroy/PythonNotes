# PythonNotes
I'm trying to learn Python so that I can use it for future hackathons. Hopefully I can fill my notes from each of the chapters from the book I'm working with! :)

Note: Every Python File I create will call all of its functions in the main function, so you can comment out a certain number of them in order to see how each of them work!
